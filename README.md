This is a Next.js app made for my Project Exam 2 during my Front-end studies. It is a booking site for a fictional tourist agency in Bergen called Holidaze where you can book establishments. The project makes calls to a headless WordPress API.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to show and develop what I have learned during my Front-end studies at [Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media](https://www.noroff.no/). 

What the project does:
- Using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to GET and POST data from Wordpress API storing establishments data.
- Using dynamic link in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that shows details about the different establishments.
- Building a login form for admin using [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).
- Let the users contact the admin using a Contact form and book establishments using a booking form.
- Admin can POST new establishments and see messages from contactform and bookingform.
